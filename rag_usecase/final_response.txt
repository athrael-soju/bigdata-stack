Llamas, as members of the camelid family, share close relationships with other species within that group. Specifically, llamas are most notably related to vicu√±as and guanacos, which are wild South American camelids. Additionally, they also have a distant relationship with domesticated animals like dromedary camels (one-humped camels) and Bactrian camels (two-humped camels). Despite the differences between species within this family, llamas share many genetic traits and physical characteristics that highlight their close relationships.
